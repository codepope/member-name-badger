# member-name-badger

Make your membership badge. Use any technology you want. We have some image [assets](./assets/README.md) - If you create more, add them to your project.

To contribute: Fork this repository and create a directory in the Badges directory with your badge code, design and other bits. Then make a pull request to pull it in. You can do this at any time.

To be a full badger: When you wear your badge to Makeroni (HackWimbledon) events, we'll ask you to tell folks all about your badge.
